# navigation.py — three-direction obstacle decisions + temporal dynamic classification

# IMPORTANT: this module only classifies a single fresh sensor reading. It
# NEVER issues lateral-movement instructions (MOVE_LEFT/MOVE_RIGHT) because
# the three forward-facing sensors cannot fully observe a side path — see
# EchoMap spec §8/§13. All turn-wait/rescan sequencing lives in main.py's
# DiscoveryController, which is the only place allowed to decide that a
# turn has been "confirmed" by a fresh post-turn scan.
